        My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 11 years old and read in class 6th grade. I started loving books at 3rd grade, my teacher encouraged me to read 30 min every night. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge,and suspense. It makes our brain grow by imagination and knowledge. By this we can be successful
